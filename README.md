## About the Book
Microsoft recently released .NET 8, a fresh and exciting release with lots of new features and performance enhancements. In this book, we will cover several frameworks such as WinForms, WPF, Windows App SDK, Blazor, and MAUI.

This book will begin with a tour of the .NET technology, including its versions and support. You will also discover how .NET evolved into a unified development platform and be introduced to a variety of desktop frameworks. The upcoming chapter will be devoted exclusively to discussing the new features and improvements in .NET 8, together with the features that are now available in the C# 12 version. Since we now have a solid grasp of .NET 8, we can get started in chapter three by using the .NET Command Line Interface (CLI) commands to create new projects and solutions. We will study this by examining several desktop application frameworks from chapters 4 to 8. The following two chapters will cover a variety of application design patterns and best practices.

Upon completion, readers will have a thorough understanding of various native desktop application development techniques, as well as the most recent C# features and how they integrate into existing design approaches.
